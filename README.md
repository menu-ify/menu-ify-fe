## About
The Menuify app allows restaurant owners to easily create mobile-friendly restaurant menus, because zooming in and out on a PDF menu can take away from the dining experience. This group project was completed in 2 1/2 weeks at the Turing School of Software and Design. Front- and Back-end teams collaborated on the design, development, and deployment processes throughout the course of the project. 

Restaurant owners can easily add/delete menus and individual menu items. While diners can easily find their desired menu with full-color images, descriptions, and prices. By placing QR codes on the tables, customers need only use their phone camera to access the menu.
