# Menuify
The Menuify app allows restaurant owners to easily create mobile-friendly restaurant menus so diners can enjoy the best possible experience. This group project was completed in 2 1/2 weeks at the Turing School of Software and Design. Front- and Back-end teams collaborated on the design, development, and deployment processes throughout the course of the project.

Restaurant owners can easily add or delete menus and individual menu items. Images can be added by url, or by searching a collection of images sourced from the Photo Unsplash API.

Diners can readily find their desired menu with full-color images, descriptions, and prices. By placing QR codes on the tables, customers need only use their mobile device to access the user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing menu.
